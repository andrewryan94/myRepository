    <h3>How we started</h3>
    <p>In 2023, six friends started EZ Shop as a small project because we were tired of purchasing fruits from supermarkets. We desired to obtain fruits directly from farmers who value quality and the environment highly. We developed a website allowing individuals to order fruits online and deliver them to their residences.</p>
