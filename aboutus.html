	<p>Burger Bomb is a locally owned and operated restaurant located in 			the downtown area. Since our establishment just last year, we have already 	begun to take the local area by storm with our innovative 
	recipes and top-notch ingredients. Burger Bomb's founders, Juan Tomas
	and his brother Jorge Tomas, are committed to providing you with a burger 		experience unlike any other. With a passion for freshness and creativity,
	we genuinely hope that you enjoy these out-of-this-world meals as much as 		we do.

	<p>Our business hours are Monday through Saturday from 11:00 AM until 			11:00 PM. Call for information about our daily specials, featured Monday through Friday. Walk-in seating, reservations, and bar seating are all available to 		customers.
